## Dependencies

To deploy a K8s cluster locally, we require the following dependencies to be installed

- kind
- docker
- kubectl (administrative tool)

These dependencies can be installed by running the following command
./script/bootstrap.sh

\*NB: This bootstrap has been tailored for Ubuntu machines only. Bootstrap will fail if run on non-Ubuntu machines.
